I'm a web developer primarily interested in AngularJS and .NET.  I have a broad background in a number of technologies and have experience bringing back end services and front end technologies together to build solutions in the modern web.

My primary interest and focus at the moment is AngularJS.  I believe Angular provides the richest framework for building Enterprise applications.  It can be coupled with other powerful libraries like ReactJS, Bootstrap and Kendo to produce powerful, clean and responsive applications.

This blog is primarily about my programming activities, but as an active rower and coach, I may post some things about that from time to time as well as anything else that sparks my interest.

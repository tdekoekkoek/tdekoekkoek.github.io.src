I'm attending this year's Connect Tech conference in Marietta, GA. This is a conference focusing on web, mobile, javascript and related technologies.  This is typically the weekend I attend the [Head of the Charles regatta](http://hocr.org).  Unfortunately for a variety of reasons, I'm not attending this year so figured I'd get in some geek learning.

## Hexo 3.0 and new theme

Before I mention the details of the conference, it behooves me to mention that I've just updated my site to the new version of [Hexo](http://hexo.io).  It was past due to do so and I decided also to update my theme.  Pretty nifty I think.

## angularjs

I've been developing in Angular for a while now, and I am trying to learn some of the best techniques for developing new Angular 2.0 application as well as learning about refactoring, profiling and migrating Angular 1 apps.  Despite 1 or 2 mediocre to poor sessions, there have been some good sessions on Angular 1 performance, in particular "Scaling large Angular 1 apps" by [Jad Joubran](https://twitter.com/JoubranJad).

## webpack

Webpack is becoming the go-to tool for bundling, minifying and packaging your web applications.  It's a powerful yet confusing tool.  John Mercer's session "Webpack: A Simple Introduction to a Complex Tool" helped clear up some of the confusion.

## NativeScript

NativeScript is an interesting tool for developing native Android, IOS and Windows Phone applications. [Jen Looper](https://twitter.com/jenlooper)'s session on Angular 2 with NativeScript was a very creative, quick intro to NativeScript while writing an interesting app using the SoundCloud API.

## Progressive Web Apps and more...

I'm about to sit in on a session about Angular 2 and Progressive Web Apps.  More on that and other topics next time...

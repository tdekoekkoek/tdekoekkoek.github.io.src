I just got started with a new service called [Visual CV](http://www.visualcv.com).  It seems like a pretty handy way to post a resume online.  They have various themes, though I'm using the free one.  You can import your resume from various sources, but I decided to import mine from [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com).  That way I can use LinkedIn as my master source and generate both an online and PDF version from it.

Once I imported my resume, it is available online at: (https://www.visualcv.com/tdekoekkoek) or on my blog at (http://tdekoekkoek.github.io/Resume/)

Now if only I can just get my LinkedIn profile up to date!
